        <p> The product that has given the world its best-known taste was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on May 8, 1886.
            <br> Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a local pharmacist, produced the syrup for Coca-Cola, and carried a jug of the new product down the street to Jacobs' Pharmacy,
            <br> where it was sampled, pronounced "excellent" and placed on sale for five cents a glass as a soda fountain drink.
            <br>Carbonated water was teamed with the new syrup to produce a drink that was at once "Delicious and Refreshing"
            <br>   a theme that continues to echo today wherever Coca-Cola is enjoyed.

                    Thinking that "the two Cs would look well in advertising," 
                    Dr. Pemberton's partner and book keeper, Frank M. Robinson, 
                    suggested the name and penned the now famous trademark "Coca-Cola" in his unique script. 
                    The first newspaper ad for Coca-Cola soon appeared in The Atlanta Journal, inviting thirsty citizens to
                    try "the new and popular soda fountain drink." Hand-painted oilcloth signs reading "Coca-Cola" 
                    appeared on store awnings, with the suggestion "Drink" added to inform passersby that the new beverage was 
                    for soda fountain refreshment. During the first year, sales averaged a modest nine drinks per day.

        <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 200px;">
            Dr. Pemberton never realized the potential of the beverage he created.
        <br>He gradually sold portions of his business to various partners and,
        <br>just prior to his death in 1888, sold his remaining interest in Coca-Cola to
        <br>Asa G. Candler. An Atlantan with great business acumen,
        <br> Mr. Candler proceeded to buy additional rights and acquire complete control.
